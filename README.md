# gol-verilog-python
Implemented Conwayâ€™s Game of Life in Verilog with a testbench simulated using ModelSim. Input patterns are provided via a Python GUI, and simulation outputs are visualized in real-time using pygame. This project combines hardware simulation with interactive Python-based input and graphical output for a seamless experience.
